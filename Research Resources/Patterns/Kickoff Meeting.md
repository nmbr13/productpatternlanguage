**Phase**:: 0 - Alignment

**Description of the problem being solved**: How might we align stakeholders and the team around a prospective problem?

**Objective:**

1. Have buy-in from all necessary stakeholders before an initiative begins
2. Inform stakeholders about timelines
3. Have a defined HMW statement to explore in research.

**Prerequisites:**

1. Some idea of the direction you wish to explore. If you are working in the Tag Management space it doesn’t do your team much good to spend a month investigating the supply chain nuances of peanuts. Come with an idea that you wish to explore. [Identifying a problem]
2. Blocked off calendars for each member of the team who will be involved in the Discovery phase as well as relevant stakeholders [Define your Stakeholders]

**Participants**:
- Key Stakeholders
- Product Trio

**How to**:

Project ideas don’t just come out of nowhere. Additionally product development takes time, valuable time, away from key members of a team. Its therefore important that you have some direction that you want to explore. This can be a nascent product idea, a pain point from a customer that you want to focus on solving or even a metric that you want to move in a particular direction. The possibilities for focus are endless and ultimately come down to your ability to align your leadership and stakeholders around an idea. This alignment comes in the form of a kickoff meeting. In this meeting you should be prepared with:

1. An observation that you want to impact or change in some way. [How to find ideas]
2. An understanding of how you intend to execute the double diamond process
3. A room (virtual or actual) with key stakeholders [See how to identify stakeholders]
