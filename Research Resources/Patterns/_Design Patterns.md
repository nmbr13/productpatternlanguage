## What are Patterns?

The elements of this pattern language are called Patterns. They are described by Christopher Alexander in his book _A Pattern Language_ as follows:

> Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over without ever doing it the same way twice.

The patterns in the document outline the types of problems you might face while working on a product development team.

## How to use the patterns

Each pattern is comprised of a name, what phase of the Double Diamond it is most commonly found, a description, who should be involved, an outline of how to implement the pattern and when available, external resources to help you go deeper.
