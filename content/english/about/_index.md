My name is Alex. Im a designer and researcher based out of Atlanta, GA. I enjoy sitting at the intersection of UX, Product and Data Science and understanding how we can uncover, describe and leverage customer stories to help make the world a better place. 

I believe that design can make someone's day and each positive momement can have a ripple effect through out the world. We owe it to our customers and collegues to listen and provide the best experience that we can. 

Outside of work I play music and enjoy exploring my neighborhood's many taquerias.
