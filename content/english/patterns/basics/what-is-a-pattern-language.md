title: " What is a Pattern Language?"
---

That's a great question in essence a pattern language is a series of solutions to common problems. It isn't an uncommon format or solution. The terminology of a "pattern language" comes from the book by the same name by architect [Christopher Alexander](https://www.google.com/search?q=christpher+alexander&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). 

## What's it for?
The Product Pattern Language is equal parts love-letter to a beautiful design philosophy as well as a set of resources for both new and experienced product designers and managers to leverage for their teams. The pattern language is a constant work in progress to share aggregated wisdom from many.  


## How to use the pattern language?
As noted, this pattern language is an homage to Christopher Alexander's work and as such follows his format for patterns. 

### What are Patterns?

The elements of this pattern language are called Patterns. They are described by Christopher Alexander in his book _A Pattern Language_ as follows:

> Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over without ever doing it the same way twice. 

The patterns in the document outline the types of problems you might face while working on a product development team.

### How to use the patterns

Each pattern is comprised of the following elements. 
- **Name** of a pattern is a way to refer to the pattern. 
- **Phases** are where in the standard double diamond process this pattern is best applied. 
- **Description** is a brief paragraph explaining the use of the pattern, what problems it solves as well as considerations to account for before applying the pattern. 
- **Participants** are who should be involved in the application of this pattern. 
- **How-to** describes how to use a pattern
- **Resources** are links out to other works which describe this pattern or other ways of using this pattern. 
- **Related Patterns** are other patterns in the pattern language which may inform or be informed by this pattern.
