title: What is Research?

# What is research?

In her book Just Enough Research, Erika Hall provides the most concise definition for research as “systematic inquiry”. That’s it. There are many styles of research and many outcomes but the key concepts that make research effective are that it is systematic and that it is inquisitive. In order to be research an activity must have both components. Asking strangers questions pulled from a hat isn’t systematic. Shouting rote Confucian proverbs at stray cats isn’t inquisitive. Both elements must be present in an activity for it to constitute research.

The good and bad news of this simple definition is that research can take on many different forms. This is good because it means that you have many options and tools to help you. It is bad because that means there are a lot of different techniques and methods to understand and work through which can be intimidating and overwhelming. How do I know what to do next? How do you know if you’re doing it right? The purpose of this document is to help you answer those questions.

# What is a Playbook?

The idea of a playbook comes from sports. It is a document that helps orchestrate the activities of a team around achieving a desired outcome. These “plays” tell each member of a team where to be, what to look out for and what their objective is. In this document you will find “plays” that will help you make the decisions and take action in the moment. Each play will tell you:

- When it applies
- Who should be involved and what their role will be
- What to do to apply this play
- What the objective is.

Each play can be leveraged in many different ways and it is up to you to apply them appropriately.
